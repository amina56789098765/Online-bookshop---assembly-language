Library Management System (Assembly & C++)
Overview
This repository contains two versions of a simple Library Management System:

A C++ implementation that allows users to add, display, search, issue, and return books.
An 8086 Assembly language implementation of an Online Book Shop with a book selection and purchasing system.
C++ Library Management System
The C++ program provides the following functionalities:

Add a book: Users can enter book details and store them in an array.
Display books: Lists all available books in the library.
Search for a book: Allows users to search for a book by title.
Issue a book: Lets users issue a book with a return deadline.
Return a book: Users can return books, and a fine is applied if returned late.
How to Use the C++ Program
Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ library.cpp -o library).
Run the executable: ./library
Follow the menu options to manage books.
Assembly Language Online Book Shop
The Assembly language program is an Online Book Store simulation that:

Displays a welcome screen.
Shows different book categories (English Novels, Urdu Novels, Islamic Books).
Allows users to select a book and enter quantity.
Calculates the total price based on the quantity.
Provides an exit option to terminate the program.
How to Run the Assembly Program
Use an 8086 emulator such as EMU8086 or MASM/TASM.
Load the Assembly source file (bookshop.asm) into the emulator.
Assemble and run the program.
Key Features
ASCII-based UI with a structured menu.
Conditional checks for valid input.
Multiplication logic for calculating the total price.
Exit and error handling for invalid inputs.
Requirements
For C++ Version
C++ Compiler (g++ for Linux/macOS or MinGW for Windows)
Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
For Assembly Version
EMU8086, MASM, or TASM (for assembling and running the code).
Basic understanding of 8086 Assembly language.
Future Improvements
Enhance the C++ version with a file-based database for book storage.
Improve Assembly code with a better UI and user input validation.
Add user authentication for issuing and returning books.
Conclusion
This repository contains a basic Library Management System implemented in C++ and Assembly language. The C++ version provides fundamental library operations, while the Assembly version simulates a simple book shop with price calculation.
